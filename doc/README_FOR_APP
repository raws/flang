Flang is a web application for managing a Wheaties instance.

== Installation

=== ExpressionEngine Database

Flang requires an ExpressionEngine MySQL database with which to authenticate. For development and test environments, a database with `exp_members` and `exp_sessions` tables will suffice.

Database connections are configured using environment variables, such as `FLANG_MYSQL_DATABASE`. In your local development environment, you may use a shell script such as `.powenv` to set up the shell environment. See `config/database.yml` for the names of environment variables used.

When deploying to Heroku, use the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to connect to your ExpressionEngine database:

    $ heroku config:add DATABASE_URL=mysql2://username:password@host/database

Heroku will rewrite `database.yml` to utilize your `DATABASE_URL` credentials.
